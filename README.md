This repo contains my configuration files (dotfiles) for the command line and
editors. My hope is to use Homely (https://github.com/phodge/homely/) to manage
installation and create scripts for easily installing these.

Iterm:
In order to use the Iterm profile stored in this directory, you will need to
follow a few simple instructions.
- Go to preferences -> general
- Click 'Load preferences from a custom folder or URL'
- Load the settings from the dotfiles/iterm directory
- Make sure to click 'Save settings to Folder' so that future changes are made there
